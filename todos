TODO: make registration form more dynamic -- have the input for first name and last name disappear and reappear depending on which role is toggled.

TODO: add "about" to the users' table -- then add ability for user to update their about info.

TODO: how do you prevent unauthorized users from seeing the buttons of other users?

TODO: restructure parameters to match backbone pattern, i.e.
  {model: user}, instead of {user: user}

  Why? b/c backbone objects automatically has ivars for mode l and collection, you don't need to set them in initialize.

TODO: !!! have features for both org and fosterers avaiable to the user for demoing purposes.

TODO: fix the navbar - make it fixed.
