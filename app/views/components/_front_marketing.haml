We believe that every adoptable animal should be given a chance to find a loving home, don't you? The problem is that sometimes there simply aren't enough spaces for animals in need. Shelter populations can vary widely, and weather events or other unforeseen circumstances can leave adoptable animals out in the cold. Sometimes a place to stay for just one night can make all the difference. Whether you represent a shelter, a rescue organization, a foster ring, or just want to learn more about how you can help, becoming a foster pal is a great way to spread the love. --If you're a shelter or a rescue organization, we connect you with people who are willing to provide a port in a storm for an animal in need. --If you're interested in providing short-term shelter to an animal awaiting adoption, we put you in touch with people who need your help." }
